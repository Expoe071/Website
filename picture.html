            alt="A fluffy puppy sits in a field bursting with bright yellow flowers. 
            The puppy's fur is a light color, like sunshine or cream. It could be a Golden Retriever, 
            with its floppy ears and friendly face. The puppy gazes upwards, mouth open in a happy grin. 
            Maybe it's panting after a playful run through the flowers, or perhaps it's simply enjoying the warm sunshine."
